# Econ 38: The Economics of Governments and Public Policy 
# Group Project 
This is a repo with .do files and .log files for my Econ 38 group project (done as part of a team of 4 students).

We attempted to estimate the effects of the 2014 medicaid expansion on voter turnout in states that accepted the expansion using a DiD instrumental variables approach.

Please email me for data files or with any feedback.
